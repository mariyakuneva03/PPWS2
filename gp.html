We based it on Eleni's artistic visions are thoughts, because she mentioned that her main target group is researchers (people interested in her specie and her activities). I worked on the design of the persona - the colors, layout.  <br>

After the logo was done we printed it and we separeted in pairs and did some user testing. We asked people what they see in the logo. Here are my notes from my research: <br>
