                    <h3>After we looked at the interviews with Eleni and her answers to the questions we asked we created our Artist Persona. We based it on Eleni's artistic visions are thoughts, because she mentioned that her main target group is researchers (people interested in her specie and her activities). I worked on the design of the persona - the colors, layout. This is the final deliverable:<br>

                    <h3>After researching Eleni's specie we found that "bradipus" means sloth. From there we started brainstorming and we came up with our idea of the logo - sloth (representing slowing down) and two people hugging with a chat bubble between them (representing connectivity). After the logo was done we printed it and we separated in pairs and did some user testing. We asked people what they see in the logo iterations. Here are my notes from my research: <br><br>
                        <a href="img/notes.png">&#x2192;My notes</a> - I was showing people the logo without the eyes (second 2 on the photo) of the sloth in both colors. From my part of the research most of the people didn't really recognised the animal and saw only objects. There were a few people that saw panda and only one recognised the sloth right away. This way we eliminated those iterations of the logo and focused on the other two(first 2 on the photo). We looked at everyone's notes from their research and we decided on which logo should we use and what should we change.<br>

Then we decided to create a site map that will be our template for our prototypes. We opened it on the big screen and did it all together. We listened to everyone's ideas and managed to create it pretty fast. This is the final deliverable:<br>
